# Hi, I’m Wei Lun Chen (陳韋綸)
this is not true yet, it's currently ai generated 

I'm an architecture graduate from Taiwan transitioning into the field of **Machine Learning for Architecture** — with a focus on **AI-driven design, spatial perception, and computational methods**. My goal is to bridge design and research through data, algorithms, and creativity.

## 🏗️ Architecture Meets AI

I'm working on:
- **Wowness Difference Index (WDI):** A method I developed to quantify architectural spatial impact using perception-based metrics.
- Generative design experiments combining ML and architectural geometry.
- Applying NLP and GNNs to spatial behavioral analysis.
